Download "RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE"
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

**Create your new hard disk for DashboardPI**
>Insert the microSD to your computer via USB adapter and create the disk image using the `dd` command
>
> Locate your inserted microSD card via the `df -h` command, unmount it and create the disk image with the disk copy `dd` command
> 
> $ `df -h`
> */dev/sdb1       7.4G   32K  7.4G   1% /media/XXX/1234-5678*
> 
> $ `umount /dev/sdb1`
> 
> **Caution: be sure the command is completely accurate, you can damage other disks with this command**
> 
> *if=location of RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE image file*
> *of=location of your microSD card*
> 
> $ `sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/sdb`
> *(note: in this case, it's /dev/sdb, /dev/sdb1 was an existing factory partition on the microSD)*

**Setting up your RaspberriPi**

*Insert your new microSD card to the raspberrypi and power it on with a monitor connected to the HDMI port*

Login
> user: **pi**
> pass: **raspberry**

Change your account password for security
>`sudo passwd pi`

Enable RaspberriPi Advanced Options
>`sudo raspi-config`

Choose:
`1 Expand File System`

`9 Advanced Options`
>`A2 Hostname`
>*change it to "EnvironmentClock"*

	}

**Reboot PI to connect to WiFi network**

>$ `sudo shutdown -r now`
>
>Now that your PI is finally on the local network, you can login remotely to it via SSH.
>But first you need to get the IP address it currently has.
>
>$ `ifconfig`
>*Look for "inet addr: 192.168.XXX.XXX" in the following command's output for your PI's IP Address*

**Go to another machine and login to your raspberrypi via ssh**

> $ `ssh pi@192.168.XXX.XXX`

**Update local timezone settings**

>$ `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`

> select your timezone using the interface

**Setup the simple directory `l` command [optional]**

>$ `vi ~/.bashrc`
>
>*add the following line:*
>
>$ `alias l='ls -lh'`
>
>$ `source ~/.bashrc`

**Fix VIM default syntax highlighting [optional]**

>$ `sudo vi /etc/vim/vimrc`
>
>uncomment the following line:
>
>_syntax on_

**Clone Clock repository**

>$ `cd ~`
>
>$ `git clone https://github.com/khinds10/EnvironmentClock.git`


**Install i2c Backpack Python Drivers**

>$ `cd ~`
>
>$ `git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_LED_Backpack`
>
>$ `cd Adafruit_Python_LED_Backpack/`
>
>$ `sudo python setup.py install`
>

**DHT11 Install**

>$ `cd ~`
>
>$ `git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git`
>
>$ `cd Adafruit_Python_DHT/`
>
>$ `sudo python setup.py install`
>
>$ `sudo python ez_setup.py`
>
>$ `cd examples/`
>
>$ `vi simpletest.py`
>

Change the following line:
> sensor = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11

Comment the line out
> pin = 'P8_11'

Uncomment the line and change the pin number to 16
> pin = 16

Run the test

`python simpletest.py`

> You should see a metric reading of Temp and Humidity displayed on the command line.

##Build and wire the device

Using a 3D printer print the enclosure files included in the 'enclosure/' folder.
.x3g files are MakerBot compatible.  You can also use the .stl and .blend (Blender Program) files to edit and create your own improvements to the design.

**1) Using 4 screws drill and attach the front panel (with the 2 holes) to the 4 sided body.  Then fit the displays in each of the holes.**

![Fit Displays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/EnvironmentClock/master/images/fit-displays.jpg "Fit Displays")

**2) Attach the 7 segment and Digole Display using hot glue gun to hold them in place.**

![Hot Glue Displays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khinds10/EnvironmentClock/master/images/attach-displays.jpg "Hot Glue Displays")

**3) Prepare the wires for connection. I use standard jumping wires and a wire cutter to strip the wire bare in the middle of the wires so I can have a bunch connected together glued with a hot glue gun.  (In the image below is my grouped together 5V / GND / SCA / and SCL wires.)**

**4) Begin wiring the unit using the wiring diagram below as a guide.**

**The 7 Segment display**
> D -> SDA
> C -> SCL
> + -> 5v
> GND -> GND
> IO -> 5v
    
**Digole Display**
> GND -> GND
> DATA -> SDA
> CLK -> SCL
> VCC -> 3V
    
**DHT11 Humidistat**
> VCC -> 5V
> GND -> GND
> DATA -> GPIO 16 / PIN 36

**5) Glue the humidistat to the back panel, and run a USB cable through the other back panel hole to power the unit.  Attach the back with only 2 screws in case you need to disassemble for repair.**

##Setup Startup Scripts

>$ `crontab -e`

Add the following lines:

`@reboot nohup python /home/pi/EnvironmentClock/clock.py >/dev/null 2>&1`

`@reboot nohup python /home/pi/EnvironmentClock/display.py >/dev/null 2>&1`

Verify the display starts working on reboot

>$ `sudo reboot`


##OPTIONAL: Creating your own weather images to render on the display

Upload your own 128x128 file to the following URL:

http://www.digole.com/tools/PicturetoC_Hex_converter.php 

Choose your image file to upload, add what size you want it to be on the screen (Width/Height)

Select "256 Color for Color OLED/LCD(1 byte/pixel)" in the "Used for" dropdown

Obtain the hex output.

Add the hex output to a display/build/ header (.h) file, use the other ones as guides for syntax.

Include the new file in the digole.c file 
`#include "myimage.h`

Include a new command line hook to your image file in the.
_Note: the command below is saying draw your image at position 10 pixels over 10  pixels down. You can change it to different X,Y coordinates, you can also change the values 128,128 to whatever size your new image actually is._

`} else if (strcmp(digoleCommand, "myimage") == 0) {`
    `drawBitmap256(10, 10, 128, 128, &myimageVariableHere,0);  // myimageVariableHere is defined in your (.h) file`
`}`

Now rebuild (ignore the errors) below to have your new image render with the following command.
>$ `./digole myimage`

**Re-Building [Included] Digole Display Driver (optional)**

>$ `cd display/build`

>$ `gcc digole.c`

>$ `mv a.out ../../digole`

>$ `chmod +x ../../digole`
